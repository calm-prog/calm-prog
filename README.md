Hi my name is Ferenc, a front-end developer based in Copenhagen.
I like collaborating on projects and I am always excited to learn about modern solutions that make development more efficient.
I currently work with technologies like TypeScript, React.
I believe that solving problems is not about how smart or educated you are, but about having the willingness to dedicate yourself to follow the tracks leading to a solution.
