## Hi, I am Ferenc, a front-end developer based in Copenhagen

I like collaborating on projects and I am always excited to learn about modern solutions that make the development process more efficient.

I believe that solving problems is not about how smart or educated you are, but about having the willingness to dedicate yourself to follow the tracks leading to the solution.

I currently like using technologies like React &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://protek.dk/react/img/react.png" width="30"> &nbsp;&nbsp;, TypeScript &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://seeklogo.com/images/T/typescript-logo-B29A3F462D-seeklogo.com.png" width="30"> &nbsp;&nbsp;, SCSS &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://www.seekpng.com/png/full/141-1415689_vendor-prefixes-for-css3-animations-using-scss-sass.png" width="30"> &nbsp;&nbsp;, or Material-UI &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://material-ui.com/static/logo.png" width="30">
